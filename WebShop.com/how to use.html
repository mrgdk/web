			<h1>How to Use</h1>
			<pre>
To be able to use this api, you only need to run the server. There are a couple of request handlers in the server. Those are:

GET,
POST,
PUT,
DELETE

If you send a get request to '/api/fetchAll' , it will bring every item's id numbers.
If you send a get request to '/api/fetch', it will fetch every item held in database.
If you send a get request to '/api/get/:phoneId' where phoneId is the id for the element you are looking for, it will fetch the data about the mentioned element.
If you send a delete request to '/api/delete', it will delete the item (in the request body) from the database.
If you send a delete request to '/api/reset', it will reset the database.
If you send a post request to '/api/create', it will create a new item which will be held in database.
If you send a put request to '/api/update', it will update the item (specified in the request body).
